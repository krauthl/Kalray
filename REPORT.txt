CMakelists to compile

Function process_file :
    - problem with the first condition -> formatting problem : adding parenthesis avoids to always get on the "return 1" line. Return 1
    should be the case where the file is not RGBA type
    - problem with y : must be < heigh

Optimization :
    - 1 "for" instead of 2 identicals -> we go through the list only once
